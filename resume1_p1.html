            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
                I am a student, studying to be a developer. My program makes 
                it a requirement to be a fast learner, and I am. I have experience in 
                fast paced environments and excellent communication skills. 
                In the past I have done freelance work building well structured, expandable 
                programs for managing data.
